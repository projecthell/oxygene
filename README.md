               DESCRIPTION : This is an updated version of the demo for Oxygéne. The
                             file contains the first six levels, use any codes you like
                             and get to MAP30. Most other mods are compatible with Oxygéne,
                             so feel free to mix and match.The demo version and final
                             version are still both under development. The demo will
                             be the first 6 or so maps.
                             The map was previously known as "The Devil Sleeps", but due
                             to personal dislike of the name, I changed it to Oxygéne.
                                     

       PACKAGE INFORMATION
                  REQUIRES : DOOM II.wad
                                   Any other wad files or pk3 files
                                   are optional.
      COMPATIBILITY ISSUES : Possible compatibility issues with mods such as BRUTAL DOOM or
                             PROJECT BRUTALITY due to this wad containing its own custom
			     enemies and weapons (which were all obtained from REALM667).
			     Basically any other pk3 file that affects enemy sprites
			     and base weapon sprites and the way they perform COULD be
			     incompatible, however I am unsure of this.
